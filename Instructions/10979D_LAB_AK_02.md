# Lab Answer Key:  Module 2: Microsoft Azure management tools
# Lab: Using Microsoft Azure management tools
  
## Exercise 1: Using the Azure PowerShell modules
  
#### Task 1: Install the Azure PowerShell modules
  
1.   On MIA-CL1, start Microsoft Edge and browse to [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/).
2.   On the **Downloads** page, in the **Command-line tools** section, locate **PowerShell**. 
3.   Below **PowerShell**, click **Windows install**. 
4.   When prompted with **What do you want to do with WindowsAzurePowerShellGet.3f.3f.3fnew.exe**, click **Save**.
5.   Click **Run**. This launches the Web Platform Installer (Web PI).
5.   If prompted by User Account Control, click **Yes**.
6.   In the **Web Platform Installer 5.0** window, note the **Install** button but do not click on it. Instead, click **Exit** to close the **Web Platform Installer 5.0** window. 

> **Note:** Azure PowerShell is already preinstalled on the lab VM.


#### Task 2: Connect to your Azure subscription
  
1.   On MIA-CL1, right-click the **Windows PowerShell ISE** shortcut on the taskbar and, in the right-click menu, click **Run ISE as Administrator**.
2.   If prompted by User Account Control, click **Yes**.
3.   In the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell ISE** window, in the console pane, type the following command, and then press Enter:
  ```
  Get-Module -ListAvailable -Name Azure*
  ```

    > **Note:** The output contains a list of a number of AzureRM.* modules, the Azure PowerShell module, and the Azure.Storage module.

4.   In the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell ISE** window, in the console pane, type the following command to sign in to your Azure subscription, and then press Enter:
  ```
  Add-AzureRmAccount
  ```
5.   When prompted in the **Sign in to your account** dialog box, in the **Email or phone** box, type the name of the Microsoft account that is the Service Administrator of your Azure subscription.
6.   In the **Password** box, type the corresponding password, and then click **Sign in**. 
> **Note:** The cmdlet returns the list of subscriptions associated with your Microsoft account.


#### Task 3: Use Azure PowerShell cmdlets
  
1.   Back in the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell ISE** window, in the console pane, type the following cmdlet to retrieve the same list of subscriptions associated with your Microsoft account, and then press Enter:
  ```
  Get-AzureRmSubscription
  ```
2.   Copy the value of the **Id** property displayed in the output of the preceding cmdlet by selecting it and then pressing Ctrl+C.
3.   Type the following cmdlet, replacing _&lt;Value of the Subscription Id property&gt;_ with the value returned by the previous cmdlet, and then press Enter:
  ```
  Select-AzureRmSubscription -SubscriptionId <Value of the Subscription Id property>
  ```

    > **Note:** If you had multiple subscriptions, you would use the preceding cmdlet to specify the Azure subscription you want to work with in the current PowerShell session.

4.   To retrieve the types of Azure Resource Manager resources you can create in your subscription, in the console pane, type the following cmdlet, and then press Enter:
  ```
  Get-AzureRmResourceProvider
  ```

    > **Note:** The cmdlet lists each Azure Resource Provider, its registration state (the provider must be registered before you can use it), and the list of resource types you can create by referencing it.

5.   To identify the list of resources that are implemented by the Microsoft.Compute provider (which includes Azure Virtual Machines), in the console pane, type the following cmdlet, and then press Enter:
  ```
  Get-AzureRmResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.Compute
  ```
6.   To identify the list of resources that are implemented by the Microsoft.Compute provider in the East US Azure region, in the console pane, type the following cmdlet, and then press Enter:
  ```
  Get-AzureRmResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.Compute -Location 'East US'
  ```
7.   Close the Windows PowerShell ISE.
8.   Leave Microsoft Edge open.

> **Result**: After you complete this exercise, you will have successfully used the Azure PowerShell modules.


## Exercise 2: Using the Azure CLI
  
#### Task 1: Install the Azure CLI
  
1.   On MIA-CL1, in Microsoft Edge, browse to [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) and, in the **Windows** section, note the **msi** link. 
2.   Do not initiate the installation. Instead, close Microsoft Edge.
 
> **Note:** Azure CLI is already preinstalled on the lab VM.


#### Task 2: Connect to your Azure subscription by using the Azure CLI
  
1.   On MIA-CL1, right-click the **Command Prompt** shortcut on the taskbar, in the pop-up menu, right-click **Command Prompt** again, and then click **Run as administrator**.
2.   If prompted by User Account Control, click **Yes**.
3.   In the **Administrator: Command Prompt** window, type the following command, and then press Enter:
  ```
  az
  ```
    > **Note:** A summary of the most-common Azure CLI commands displays.

4.   At the command prompt, type the following command, and then press Enter:
  ```
  az login
  ```
    > **Note:** At this point, you will be presented with a message stating **To sign-in, use a web browser to open the page https://aka.ms/devicelogin. Enter the code _XXXXXXXXX_ to authenticate**, where **_XXXXXXXXX_** is a random string of characters.

5.   On MIA-CL1, start Microsoft Edge and browse to **https://aka.ms/devicelogin**. 
6.   On the **Device Login** page, type the code included in the message displayed in step 4.
7.   Once you type in the code, you will be presented with another page identifying the Microsoft Azure CLI as the application that you are attempting to sign in to. Click **Continue**. You will be automatically redirected to the **Microsoft Azure** sign-in page.
8.   On the **Sign in to your account page,** in the **Email or phone** box type the name of the Microsoft account that is the Service Administrator of your Azure subscription.
9.   In the **Password** box, type the corresponding password, and then click **Sign in**. 
    > **Note:** At this point, you will be presented with the **Windows Azure Cross-platform Command Line Interface** page, stating **You have signed in to the Windows Azure Cross-platform Command Line Interface on your device. You may now close the window**.

10.   Close the **Microsoft Edge** window as instructed.
11.   Back in the **Administrator: Command Prompt** window, note the JSON-formatted output displaying information about the current session, including the ID of the subscription that your account is associated with. 
12.   In case of an error, repeat the steps 4 through 11.


#### Task 3: Manage your Azure subscription by using the Azure CLI
 
 
1.   List your subscriptions by typing the following command at the command prompt and then pressing Enter:
  ```
  az account list
  ```
    > **Note:** This command produces the same JSON-formatted output that was displayed after you successfully authenticated in the previous task.
2.   Copy the value of the **id** property displayed in the output of the preceding command by selecting it and then pressing Ctrl+C.
3.   Type the following command, paste the copied entry after the _--subscription_ parameter, and then press Enter:
  ```
  az account set --subscription <value of the subscription id property>
  ```

    > **Note:** If you had multiple subscriptions, you would use the preceding command to specify the Azure subscription you want to work with in the current Azure CLI session.

5.   To retrieve the types of Azure Resource Manager providers available in your subscription, at the command prompt, type the following command, and then press Enter:
  ```
  az provider list
  ```

    > **Note:** The output of the command contains JSON-formatted list of each Azure Resource Provider available in your subscription and its registration state (the provider must be registered before you can use it).

6.   To list all Azure regions available in the current subscription, at the command prompt, type the following command, and then press Enter:
  ```
  az account list-locations
  ```
7.   To identify the list of resources that are implemented by the Microsoft.Compute provider (which includes Azure Virtual Machines) along with the list of locations where they are available, at the command prompt, type the following command, and then press Enter:
  ```
  az provider show --namespace Microsoft.Compute
  ```
8.   Close the **Administrator: Command Prompt** window.


#### Task 4: Prepare for the next module
  
When you are finished with the lab, do not revert the virtual machines. Please keep all of the VMs running. The VMs in their current state are required for the next module.

> **Result**: After completing this exercise, you have used the Azure CLI.
