## Exercise 1: Create a VM from the Azure Portal by using an Azure Marketplace image
  
### Scenario
  
To prepare for deployment of a new Azure-dedicated VM, you decide to test the process of creating a new Azure VM from the Azure Portal by using an Azure Marketplace Windows Server 2016 Datacenter image.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1.   Select and create a VM
2.   Verify VM creation


#### Task 1: Select and create a VM
  
1.   On MIA-CL1, start Microsoft Edge and browse to **http://portal.azure.com**. Sign in to the Azure Portal as the Service Administrator or a Co-Administrator of your Azure subscription.
2.   From the Azure Portal, create a new VM by using the Windows Server 2016 Datacenter Marketplace image and Resource Manager deployment model with the following settings:

  -   Name: **10979D03LabVM1**
  
  -   VM Disk type: **HDD** 

  -   User name: **Student**

  -   Password: **Pa55w.rd1234**

  -   Subscription: _Your Azure subscription_

  -   Resource group: **Create new**

  -   New resource group: **10979D03-LabRG01**

  -   Location: _Azure region closest to the classroom location that is available in your subscription_

  -   Size: **D1_V2 Standard**

  -   Use managed disks: **Yes**

  -   Virtual network: _Accept the default value (this will create a new virtual network)_

  -   Subnet: _Accept the default value (this will create a /24 subnet named **default** within the IP address space of the virtual network)_

  -   Public IP address: **(new) 10979D03LabVM1-ip**

  -   Network security group: **(new) 10979D03LabVM1-nsg**

  -   Extensions: **No extensions**

  -   Availability set: **None**

  -   Boot Diagnostics: **Disabled**

  -   Guest OS Diagnostics: **Disabled**

3.   Note the **Deployment started** message in the notification area at the top of the page.
4.   Wait for the deployment to complete.


#### Task 2: Verify VM creation
  
1.   On MIA-CL1, in the Microsoft Edge window, in the Azure Portal, once the deployment of the 10979D03LabVM1 VM completes, you will be automatically presented with the **10979D03LabVM1** blade. If that is not the case, navigate to the **10979D03LabVM1** blade.
2.   Click **Activity log**. Note that the blade allows you to search for activities affecting the VM that you or other admins carried out.
3.   Click **Overview**. 
4.   Click **Resource health**.
5.   Verify that there are no known Azure platform problems affecting this VM. Click **Refresh** if you receive a "Resource health unknown' message.
6.   Close the Resource health blade.

> **Result**: After completing this lab, you should have created a Microsoft Azure virtual machine (VM) from the Azure Portal by using an Azure Marketplace image, as well as review activity logs and resource health of the VM.


## Exercise 2: Verify the functionality of the VM
  
### Scenario
  
You successfully deployed your lab Azure VM running Windows Server 2016 Datacenter. Now you want to examine its properties from the Azure Portal and connect to it by using RDP.

1.   On MIA-CL1, switch to the Remote Desktop session window. If prompted, on the Networks pane, click **No**.
2.   While connected to the 10979D03LabVM1 Azure VM, from the **Server Manager** window, create a storage pool named **StoragePool1**, consisting of two newly attached disks. 
3.   From the Server Manager window, create a new virtual disk named **VirtualDisk1** by using **StoragePool1** with the **Simple** storage layout, the **Fixed** provisioning type, and the maximum size.
4.   From the Server Manager window, create a new 254 GB volume as drive F formatted with the NTFS file system and a default allocation unit.
5.   From the desktop of, 10979D03LabVM1 open File Explorer and verify that there is a new drive F with 253 GB of available disk space.
6.   Close the Remote Desktop session to 10979D03LabVM1.
7.   Close all open windows on MIA-CL1.


#### Task 3: Prepare for the next module
  
1.   From MIA-CL1, start Microsoft Edge, browse to **http://portal.azure.com**, and, if prompted, sign in by using the Microsoft account that is the Service Administrator of your Azure subscription.
2.   From the Azure Portal, delete the **10979D03-LabRG01** resource group.
3.   Unpin 10979D03LabVM1 tile from the Azure portal dashboard.
4.   Close Microsoft Edge.

When you are finished with the lab, do not revert the VMs. Please keep all of the VMs running. The VMs in their current state are required for the next module.

> **Result**: After completing this lab, you should have attached two data disks to the Azure VM from the Azure Portal and created a two-disk volume in an Azure VM that runs Windows Server 2016 by using Storage Spaces.


**Question**
