## Exercise 1: Using the Azure PowerShell modules
  
### Scenario
  
In this exercise, you will use the Azure PowerShell modules.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1.   Install the Azure PowerShell modules
2.   Connect to your Azure subscription
3.   Use Azure PowerShell cmdlets


#### Task 1: Install the Azure PowerShell modules
  
1.   On MIA-CL1, start Microsoft Edge, and then browse to [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/). 
2.   Download **WindowsAzurePowerShellGet.3f.3f.3fnew.exe** and start Web Platform Installer.
3.   In the **Web Platform Installer 5.0** window, note the **Install** button but do not click on it. Instead, click **Exit** to close the **Web Platform Installer 5.0** window. 

> **Note:** Azure PowerShell is already preinstalled on the lab VM.


#### Task 2: Connect to your Azure subscription
  
1.   On MIA-CL1, start the Windows PowerShell ISE as an administrator.
2.   In the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell ISE** window, list all the available Azure PowerShell modules by running the following cmdlet:
  ```
  Get-Module -ListAvailable -Name Azure*
  ```

    > **Note:** The output contains a list of a number of AzureRM.* modules, the Azure PowerShell module, and the Azure.Storage module.

3.   Sign in to your Azure subscription with the Microsoft account that is the Service Administrator of your Azure subscription by running the following Azure PowerShell cmdlet: 

```
Add-AzureRmAccount
```
> **Note:** The cmdlet returns the list of subscriptions associated with your Microsoft account.


#### Task 3: Use Azure PowerShell cmdlets
  
1.   Back in the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell ISE** window, in the console pane, retrieve the list of subscriptions associated with your Microsoft account by running the following cmdlet:
  ```
  Get-AzureRmSubscription
  ```
2.   Select the target Azure subscription by running the following cmdlet, replacing _&lt;Value of the SubscriptionId property&gt;_ with the value of the **Subscription Id** property returned by the **Get-AzureRmSubscription** cmdlet:
  ```
  Select-AzureRmSubscription -SubscriptionId <Value of the SubscriptionId property>
  ```

    > **Note:** If you had multiple subscriptions, you would use the preceding cmdlet to specify the Azure subscription you want to work with in the current PowerShell session.

3.   Retrieve the types of Azure Resource Manager resources you can create in your subscription by running the following cmdlet:
  ```
  Get-AzureRmResourceProvider
  ```

    > **Note:** The cmdlet lists each Azure Resource Provider, its registration state (the provider must be registered before you can use it), and the list of resource types you can create by referencing it.

4.   Identify the list of resources that are implemented by the Microsoft.Compute Azure Resource Manager resource provider (which includes Azure Virtual Machines) by running the following cmdlet:
  ```
  Get-AzureRmResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.Compute
  ```
5.   Identify the list of resources that are implemented by the Microsoft.Compute Azure Resource Manager resource provider in the East US Azure region by running the following cmdlet:
  ```
  Get-AzureRmResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.Compute -Location 'East US'
  ```
6.   Close the Windows PowerShell ISE.
7.   Leave Microsoft Edge open.

> **Result**: After you complete this exercise, you will have successfully used the Azure PowerShell modules.


## Exercise 2: Using the Azure CLI
