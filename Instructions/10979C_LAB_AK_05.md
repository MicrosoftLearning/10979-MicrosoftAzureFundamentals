# Lab: Create a virtual network
  
## Exercise 1: Creating a virtual network
  
#### Task 1: Create a virtual network by using Azure Portal
  
1.   From MIA-CL1, start Internet Explorer, go to  **http://portal.azure.com**, and then, when prompted, sign in by using the Microsoft account that is either the Service Administrator or Co-Administrator of your Azure subscription. 
2.   In the  **Hub** vertical menu on the left side of the portal page, click **New**.
3.   On the  **New** blade, click **Networking**.
4.   On the  **Networking** blade, click **Virtual Network**.
5.   On the  **Virtual Network** blade, ensure that **Resource Manager** appears in the **Select a deployment model** drop-down list, and then click **Create**.
6.   On the  **Create virtual network** blade, specify the following settings, and then click **Create**:
  -   Name:  **labVNet**

  -   Address space:  **10.3.0.0/20**

  -   Subnet name:  **Subnet1**

  -   Subnet address range:  **10.3.0.0/24**

  -   Subscription:  _Your Azure subscription_

  -   Resource group:  **Create new**

  -   New resource group name:  **labVNetRG**

  -   Location: Azure data center closest to the location of your classroom

  -   Pin to dashboard: Select the check box.
    >  **Note:** Ignore any messages about overlapping address spaces that might appear when you type the value in the **Address space** text box.


7.   Leave Internet Explorer with the Azure portal interface open. You will use it in the next exercise of this lab.

>  **Result**: After completing this exercise, you should have created a new Azure virtual network by using the Azure portal.
